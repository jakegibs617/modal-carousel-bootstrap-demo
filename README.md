# modal-carousel-bootstrap-demo

Use boostrap's modal-carousel to have a slideshow in a popup window

use MAMP to store file and open in the local host 8888 like http://localhost:8888/demo_git/index.php


the idea here is to click on the custom designed slideshow indicator; keeping things clean and simple.
